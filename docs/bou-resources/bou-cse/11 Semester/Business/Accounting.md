## **18.3 The Accounting Equation**

### ✅ Formula:

**Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity**

This equation shows that:

---

### ✅ Key Terms Explained:

* **Assets**:
  What the business owns (cash, buildings, stock, furniture).

* **Liabilities**:
  What the business owes to others (loans, salaries, bills).

* **Owners’ Equity**:
  The owner’s claim on the business after paying liabilities.
  (Assets left after debts)

* **Revenues**:
  Earnings or income from sales or services.

* **Expenses**:
  Costs or payments made for running the business (salaries, rent, etc.)

### ✅ Example for Better Understanding:

Let’s say:

* A business owns ₹10 lakh in assets.
* It owes ₹6 lakh to others.

Then:
**Owners’ Equity = ₹10 lakh – ₹6 lakh = ₹4 lakh**
