**Q1(a):**
**State Gauss’s Law** in electrostatics and explain its physical significance. Then, using a suitable **Gaussian surface and symmetry**, **derive Coulomb’s Law** for the electric field intensity due to a point charge from Gauss’s Law. Include all necessary mathematical steps and assumptions.

---

### ✅ Structured Answer:

---

## 🔷 **1. Gauss’s Law – Statement**

> **Gauss’s Law** states that:
> *“The total electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the net electric charge enclosed by that surface divided by the permittivity of free space.”*

### 🔸 **Mathematical Form:**

$$
\boxed{\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}}
$$

Where:

* $\vec{E}$ = Electric field vector
* $d\vec{A}$ = Infinitesimal area vector on closed surface
* $q_{\text{enc}}$ = Net charge enclosed inside the surface
* $\varepsilon_0$ = Permittivity of free space $(8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m})$

---

## 🔷 **2. Physical Significance of Gauss’s Law**

* Relates **electric field** and **charge distribution**
* Useful in calculating **electric field** when there is **high symmetry** (spherical, cylindrical, planar)
* A fundamental law in **Maxwell’s equations**

---

## 🔷 **3. Deduction of Coulomb’s Law from Gauss’s Law**

We will now derive **Coulomb’s Law** (electric field due to a point charge) using **Gauss’s Law**.

---

### ✅ **Assumptions:**

* Let a **point charge $q$** be placed at the **origin**.
* Choose a **spherical Gaussian surface** of radius $r$ centered at the point charge.

### ✅ **Step 1: Apply Gauss’s Law**

$$
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Due to spherical symmetry:

* $\vec{E}$ is **constant** in magnitude over the surface
* $\vec{E} \parallel d\vec{A}$, so $\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = E\,dA$

$$
E \oint dA = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Evaluate Surface Area**

Total surface area of a sphere of radius $r$:

$$
\oint dA = 4\pi r^2
$$

Substitute:

$$
E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Solve for $E$**

$$
\boxed{E = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r^2}}
$$

This is **Coulomb’s Law** for electric field intensity due to a point charge.

---

## 🔷 **4. Vector Form of Electric Field**

$$
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
$$

Where $\hat{r}$ is the **unit vector** pointing **radially outward** from the charge (if $q > 0$).

---

## 🔷 **5. From Field to Force (Coulomb’s Force)**

Force on a test charge $q_0$:

$$
\vec{F} = q_0 \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q q_0}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
$$

This is the **standard form of Coulomb’s Law**.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion:**

* **Gauss’s Law** provides a powerful and elegant method for evaluating electric fields using symmetry and surface integrals.
* By applying it to a spherical surface around a **point charge**, we easily deduce **Coulomb’s Law**, which was historically discovered first but can now be derived from more fundamental laws.
