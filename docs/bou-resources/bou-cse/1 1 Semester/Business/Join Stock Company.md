## **Memorandum of Association (M/A)**

### Easy Definition:

The **Memorandum of Association** is the main document of a company. It explains the **basic details** about the company like:

* Its **name** and **address**
* What kind of **business** it will do
* How much **capital** it will have
* What will be the **liability** of its members

### With Analogy:

Think of the **M/A as the birth certificate** of a company. Just like a birth certificate records your name, place, and identityâ€”M/A records the identity and purpose of the company.

It tells **why** the company exists and **what it is allowed to do**.

---

## **Articles of Association (A/A)**

### Easy Definition:

The **Articles of Association** is a rulebook that explains **how the company will run its daily operations**. It includes the rules for:

* Internal management
* Rights and responsibilities of members
* Procedures for meetings, appointments, voting, etc.

### With Analogy:

Think of the **A/A as the companyâ€™s user manual or instruction guide**. While M/A shows what the company is, A/A shows **how it works every day**.

Itâ€™s like the rulebook of a club â€” explaining how members will work together, make decisions, and solve problems.

---

## Key Difference in Simple Words:

| Memorandum of Association (M/A)  | Articles of Association (A/A)          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| What the company **is and does** | How the company is **run and managed** |
| Like a **birth certificate**     | Like a **rulebook/manual**             |
| Defines **external purpose**     | Controls **internal operations**       |
| Canâ€™t be changed easily          | Can be changed by special resolution   |

Here's a clear, formal, and easy-to-understand explanation of **Shares and Debentures**, along with their **differences**, presented in a simplified manner for note-taking.

---

## **Shares and Debentures (Simplified Explanation)**

### **What is a Share?**

* A **share** is a part of a companyâ€™s capital.
* When someone buys shares, they become a **part-owner** (shareholder) of the company.
* They share in the companyâ€™s **profits and losses**.

### **What is a Debenture?**

* A **debenture** is a loan given to the company.
* The person who gives the loan is a **creditor** (debenture holder), not an owner.
* Debentures come with a **fixed interest** rate.

---

## **Differences Between Share and Debenture**

| **Point**                | **Share**                                            | **Debenture**                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Position**             | Provides capital to the company                      | Provides debt (loan) to the company           |
| **Ownership**            | Shareholder is an **owner**                          | Debenture holder is a **creditor**            |
| **Profit**               | Gets **dividend** from profit                        | Gets **fixed interest**, even if no profit    |
| **Liability**            | Affected by profit/loss                              | Not concerned with profit/loss                |
| **Managing the Company** | Can **participate in management** decisions          | **No role** in management                     |
| **Meetings & Voting**    | Has **right to attend** meetings and vote            | **No right** to attend or vote                |
| **Rights & Obligations** | Mentioned in the **Memorandum of Association**       | Mentioned in the **Articles of Association**  |
| **Sale**                 | Shares can be issued at company formation or anytime | Debentures usually issued after formation     |
| **Indicates**            | Certificate proves ownership (not a unique deed)     | Debenture itself is a unique ownership deed   |
| **Security Needed**      | No security required for issuing shares              | Security may be needed to issue debentures    |
| **Decision Expression**  | Shareholders can give opinions or vote               | Debenture holders **cannot** express opinions |
| **During Winding Up**    | **Paid after** creditors                             | **Paid before** shareholders                  |

---

### Simple Analogy:

* **Shareholder** = *Business Partner* (shares profit/loss, has voice in company)
* **Debenture Holder** = *Lender or Banker* (wants fixed return, no interest in company decisions)
