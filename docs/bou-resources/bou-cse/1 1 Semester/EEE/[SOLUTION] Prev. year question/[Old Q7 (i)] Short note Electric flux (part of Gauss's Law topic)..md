## üî∑ **1. Definition of Electric Flux ( $\Phi_E$ )**

Electric flux is a **measure of the number of electric field lines** passing through a **surface**. It quantifies how much of the electric field penetrates a given area and is fundamental in applying **Gauss‚Äôs Law**.

---

### üî∏ **Mathematical Expression:**

For a **uniform electric field** $\vec{E}$ and a flat surface area $\vec{A}$:

$$
\Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = EA\cos\theta
$$

Where:

* $\Phi_E$ = Electric flux
* $\vec{E}$ = Electric field vector
* $\vec{A}$ = Area vector (magnitude = area, direction = normal to surface)
* $\theta$ = Angle between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{A}$

---

### üî∏ **For Curved or Non-uniform Surfaces:**

$$
\Phi_E = \int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}
$$

This integral sums contributions of all infinitesimal area elements.

## üî∑ **2. Electric Flux Through a Closed Surface: Gauss‚Äôs Law Form**

When the surface is **closed** (like a sphere or cylinder), total electric flux becomes:

$$
\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

This is **Gauss‚Äôs Law**, which states:

> *The total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space.*

---

## üî∑ **3. Physical Significance of Electric Flux**

* **More field lines ‚Üí more flux**
* **Flux is maximum** when $\vec{E} \parallel \vec{A}$ (i.e., $\theta = 0^\circ$)
* **Flux is zero** when $\vec{E} \perp \vec{A}$ (i.e., $\theta = 90^\circ$)
* Helps determine **net enclosed charge** without needing detailed field calculations

## üî∑ **4. Units and Dimensional Formula**

| Property                | Value                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **SI Unit**             | $\text{N¬∑m}^2/\text{C}$ |
| **Dimensional Formula** | $[ML^3T^{-3}A^{-1}]$    |

---

## üî∑ **5. Application in Gauss‚Äôs Law**

Electric flux is the **core concept** in Gauss's Law, which allows us to:

* Easily compute electric fields for **high-symmetry charge distributions**
  (e.g., point charge, line charge, spherical shell)
* Replace complex integration of Coulomb‚Äôs Law with **simple flux evaluation**

---

### ‚úÖ **Example: Point Charge Inside a Sphere**

For a point charge $q$ placed at the center of a spherical surface of radius $r$:

* Electric field at all points on the surface is constant in magnitude and radial
* Total flux through the surface:

$$
\Phi_E = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}
\Rightarrow E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r^2}
$$

This shows how **flux and symmetry** help derive **field intensity** easily.
