## üìò Compounding (Word-Making Technique)

### ‚úÖ **Easy Definition (Formal but Clear):**

**Compounding** is a process of forming a **new word** by **joining two or more words together**. Each word (called a *lexeme*) has its own meaning, but when combined, they create a new meaning.

üîç **Analogy (Example for Better Understanding):**
Think of compounding like **mixing two ingredients to make a new dish**.
For example, **rice + milk = rice pudding**. Each item has its own identity, but when combined, it becomes something new.

Just like that:
**Note** + **Book** ‚Üí **Notebook** (not just a note or a book, but a place to write notes!)

## Clipping (Word Shortening Trick)

### ‚úÖ **Easy Definition (Formal but Clear):**

**Clipping** is a process where we **shorten a longer word**, but **keep its meaning the same**. The short form is used in casual or everyday conversation.

---

### üîç **Analogy (Real-life Comparison):**

Think of clipping like giving someone a **nickname**.

* Just like **‚ÄúJonathan‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúJon‚Äù**,
* The word **‚Äúadvertisement‚Äù becomes ‚Äúad‚Äù**.

The short version is easier and faster, but you still understand who or what it refers to.

## Blending (Word Mixing Technique)

### ‚úÖ **Easy Definition (Formal but Clear):**

**Blending** is the process of **mixing parts of two or more words** to make a **new word**, which often combines the **meanings** of the original words.

---

### üîç **Analogy (Real-life Comparison):**

Think of blending like making a **smoothie** ‚Äî you take parts of two fruits (like banana + strawberry), blend them, and get a **new flavor**.

Example:
**Breakfast** + **Lunch** = **Brunch**
‚Üí It‚Äôs not just one or the other ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mix of both meals!

---

## üß™ How Blending Works:

* You take **some letters/syllables** from each word (usually the beginning of one and the end of another).
* Then **combine** them into **one smooth word**.
* The new word **shares the meaning** of both.

### ‚úÖ Final Thought:

**Compounding is like teamwork between words.** When two words work together, they form a new identity ‚Äî just like when two people form a team, they can do something new together.

**Clipping is like shortcutting words for faster speech**, just like you shorten your friends‚Äô names for casual use. The full word and the short word **mean the same**, but the clipped one is quicker to say or write.

**Blending is like word fusion.** You take a little from this, a little from that, and make something **new and meaningful** ‚Äî just like mixing two paints to get a new color!
