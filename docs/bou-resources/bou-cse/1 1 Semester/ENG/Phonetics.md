Here's the updated version of your table with **"Phonetic"** included and clearly **distinguished from "Phonetics"**:

| **Phoneme**                | Smallest sound unit that changes meaning                        | Functional unit in a language (part of phonology)        | /b/ in *bat* vs /p/ in *pat* ‚Üí different words               |

### üîç The ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ part:

> ‚úÖ **Phonetics** is a **branch of linguistics** that deals with how speech sounds are made, transmitted, and heard.
> ‚úÖ **Phonetic** is just the **adjective form** ‚Äî it describes anything related to speech sounds (e.g., phonetic symbols, phonetic alphabet).
> ‚úÖ **Phonology** is about how **sounds function** in specific languages ‚Äî the **abstract, rule-based** system of speech.

---

### üîÅ Recap with Example:

* üîä **Phonetics**:
  Includes **every sound** the human mouth can make, like clicks, guttural sounds, nasal hums‚Äîeven if no major language uses them.

* üó£Ô∏è **Phonology**:
  Focuses only on **meaningful sounds** (*phonemes*) in a language like English, Bangla, etc.
  For example, in English:

  * /t/ and /d/ = **different phonemes** (*tip* ‚â† *dip*)
  * /t ∞/ (aspirated t, like in *top*) and /t/ (non-aspirated t) = **not different phonemes** in English, but **they are** in Hindi!

So yes, you now fully understand the **core difference**:

| Area          | Covers                            | Used For                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Phonetics** | All speech sounds (global)        | Physical study of sound              |
| **Phonology** | Only meaningful sounds (phonemes) | How a language **uses** those sounds |

Great! I‚Äôve reviewed your chart and the newly uploaded class notes, and I‚Äôve **improved and expanded your IPA chart** by:

1. Correcting/aligning all **IPA phoneme categories** (Vowels, Diphthongs, Consonants).
2. Adding **Bengali pronunciation hints**.
3. Incorporating **examples** and **insights from the handwritten notes** (e.g. voiced/unvoiced, affricates, nasal, etc.).
