### ðŸ“Œ Tips & Tricks

* **Donâ€™t memorize code blindly** â€” trace it with pen & paper.
* **Write code snippets by hand** to build intuition.
* Focus on **flowchart/algorithm questions early** â€” theyâ€™re easy marks.
* Repeatedly asked areas: `loops`, `file handling`, `functions`, `arrays`.
* In the exam: **Attempt full 5 questions**. Donâ€™t leave subparts blank.
* Use mnemonics: e.g., for file modes â†’ `"r", "w", "a", "r+", etc.` = *Read Write Append Read+Write*
