### 🔍 The confusion:

You're wondering why **1 mole** of **sodium (Na)** weighs **23 grams**, while **1 mole** of **copper (Cu)** weighs **63.5 grams**, yet **both contain the same number of atoms**, which is **Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³ atoms)**.

It feels strange because copper is **heavier**, so how can the **same number** of atoms weigh more?

### ✅ The answer lies in **atomic mass**:

* Each **sodium atom** has a mass of about **23 atomic mass units (amu)**.
* Each **copper atom** has a mass of about **63.5 amu**.

So, atom by atom, **copper atoms are heavier** than sodium atoms.

That’s why:

* To get **6.022 × 10²³ sodium atoms**, you only need **23 grams**.
* But to get **6.022 × 10²³ copper atoms**, you need **63.5 grams**.

### 🔬 Analogy:

Imagine you're counting 100 fruits:

* 100 grapes will weigh less.
* 100 mangoes will weigh more.
* But you still have **100 fruits** in both cases.

The **number is the same**, but **the mass depends on how heavy each item is**.

---

### 🧪 In chemistry terms:

* **Molar mass** (in grams/mole) = **atomic mass** (in amu), but on a bigger scale.
* So 1 mole of any element = **Avogadro’s number of atoms**, but the mass (in grams) depends on the **type of atom**.
