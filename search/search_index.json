Just like a human body needs different organs (heart, brain, lungs) to function properly, a business needs several parts (like production, marketing, finance, etc.) to run smoothly and successfully.</p> <p>Trade is considered the final stage of business activities. It involves the buying and selling of goods and services between individuals or institutions. Trade ensures that the products and services reach the final consumers in exchange for money or other goods. It can be broadly divided into two types:</p> <p>(a) Home Trade: When trade is conducted within the boundaries of a country, it is called home trade. It includes both wholesale and retail trade. (b) Foreign Trade: When trade takes place across national borders, it is called foreign trade. It includes import (buying from other countries), export (selling to other countries), and entrep\u00f4t trade (importing for the purpose of re-exporting).</p> <p>Commerce refers to all the activities that help in the process of trade. It includes not only buying and selling but also various supporting services such as transportation, warehousing, packaging, banking, insurance, finance, and advertising. These services are collectively known as \"aids to trade.\" The primary function of commerce is to remove obstacles related to person, place, time, risk, finance, and information. For example, transport removes the hindrance of place, warehousing removes the hindrance of time, insurance reduces the risk of loss, and advertising overcomes the lack of knowledge about the product.</p> <p>Industry is that part of business which is involved in the production of goods and materials. It includes activities that raise, extract, process, and convert raw materials into finished or semi-finished goods. Industry may be classified into three types:</p> <p>(a) Primary Industry: This includes activities that involve the use of natural resources, such as agriculture, mining, fishing, and forestry. (b) Secondary Industry: This refers to the manufacturing and construction sector, where raw materials are processed into usable goods. (c) Tertiary Industry: This includes service-based industries such as banking, education, health care, and transport.</p> <p>These three components\u2014trade, commerce, and industry\u2014are closely interrelated and interdependent. Industry provides the goods, commerce facilitates their movement and exchange, and trade completes the transaction by selling the goods to the consumers. Together, they form a complete business cycle essential for the economic development of a country.</p>"},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/Business/Introduction%20to%20Business/#main-components-of-business-explained-simply","title":"Main Components of Business (Explained Simply):","text":""},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/Business/Introduction%20to%20Business/#1-production-or-procurement","title":"1.

What makes him so special to me is not just that he was a prophet, but the kind of extraordinary person he was in every role of life. He was a perfect human being \u2014 an ideal father, teacher, leader, friend, and even a warrior.</p> <p>As a father, he was loving and gentle. He used to stand up when his daughter Fatima (RA) entered the room and treated her with the highest respect. He played with children, smiled at them, and never scolded them harshly. His love for his family was deep, but he was also fair and never gave them special treatment.</p> <p>As a teacher, he was patient, wise, and clear. He taught people through simple words and even simpler actions. He never forced people but inspired them with kindness and good character. His life itself was the greatest lesson. He said, \u201cThe best among you are those who have the best manners.\u201d</p> <p>As a warrior, he was brave yet merciful. In battles, he showed discipline and only fought to defend truth and justice. He never attacked innocent people and even forgave enemies who once tried to harm him. Despite being powerful, he remained humble and avoided pride.</p> <p>As a leader, he was honest, just, and caring. He lived a simple life, shared food with the poor, and treated everyone equally \u2014 rich or poor, black or white. Even his enemies trusted him for his honesty.</p> <p>Hazrat Muhammad (SM)\u2019s life teaches me how to live with dignity, love, and responsibility. His character is a complete model for all humanity. That is why he is not only my favourite personality, but also my greatest inspiration.</p>"},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/ENG/Letter%20Writing/#-_1","title":"---","text":"<p>To: sabrina.aussie@gmail.com Subject: Tips to Adjust to Life in Australia</p> <p>Dear Sabrina,</p> <p>I hope this email finds you well. I heard you\u2019ve finally settled in Australia \u2014 congratulations! I can imagine how exciting and challenging this new journey must be for you.</p> <p>Moving to a new country is never easy at first, but with time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll adjust. Try to keep an open mind about the new culture and lifestyle. Australians are friendly and informal, so don\u2019t hesitate to talk to people and make new friends. It will help you feel more at home.</p> <p>About the food, I know it can be different from what we\u2019re used to, but give it a try! You might enjoy some of the local dishes like meat pies, fish and chips, or even Vegemite (though it's an acquired taste!). At the same time, explore nearby Asian or Indian stores \u2014 you\u2019ll likely find ingredients to cook your favourite Bangladeshi meals too.</p> <p>Also, try to adapt to their daily routine, time zone, and weather. Australia\u2019s climate is quite different, so dress accordingly and stay healthy. Don't be shy about asking for help or information \u2014 people there usually appreciate curiosity and respect for their culture.</p> <p>Lastly, stay connected with your roots but embrace the change. This experience will help you grow and learn in ways you never imagined.</p> <p>Take care and write back soon. I\u2019d love to hear about your new experiences!</p> <p>Warm wishes, Rakib</p>"},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/ENG/Letter%20Writing/#-_2","title":"---","text":""},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/ENG/Phonetics/","title":"Phonetics","text":"<p>Here's the updated version of your table with \"Phonetic\" included and clearly distinguished from \"Phonetics\":</p> Term Meaning Focus Area / Function Example / Note Speech Sound Any sound used in human speech General sounds used in spoken language /b/, /p/, /s/, /m/ are all speech sounds Phoneme Smallest sound unit that changes meaning Functional unit in a language (part of phonology) /b/ in bat vs /p/ in pat \u2192 different words Phonetic (adj.)

While many still prefer the security of government jobs, the rapidly growing tech industry offers limitless possibilities for innovation and independence. This essay argues that CSE graduates should seriously consider preparing for entrepreneurship rather than solely focusing on government employment, as it offers greater opportunities for creativity, self-growth, and national development.</p> <p>Firstly, entrepreneurship allows CSE graduates to use their technical skills in creative and independent ways. In government jobs, tasks are often routine, structured, and limited by bureaucracy. On the other hand, a CSE graduate starting a tech startup can develop mobile apps, AI systems, or software products that directly solve real-world problems. This flexibility allows them to express innovation and contribute meaningfully to society.</p> <p>Secondly, entrepreneurship provides financial freedom and long-term growth potential. Government jobs offer fixed salaries and slow promotions, which may not reflect the true capabilities of a skilled CSE graduate. In contrast, a successful tech entrepreneur can earn significantly more, create jobs for others, and even attract global investment. Many tech giants like Pathao, Sheba.xyz, or bKash were started by bold individuals, not job seekers.</p> <p>Thirdly, entrepreneurs can contribute more actively to national progress and the digital economy. Bangladesh needs more job creators, not job seekers. When CSE graduates build startups, they create employment, reduce brain drain, and promote technological advancement in the country. This is more impactful than serving in limited government positions where innovation may be restricted.</p> <p>However, government jobs still hold value for those seeking stability and service to the nation through public institutions. Some graduates may prefer a fixed path and pension system. But CSE, being a field of innovation, aligns better with entrepreneurial ventures than with traditional government roles.</p> <p>In conclusion, while government jobs offer stability, entrepreneurship offers freedom, innovation, and growth. For CSE graduates, whose skills are suited for rapid digital transformation, entrepreneurship is not only a personal opportunity but also a national necessity. Therefore, it is wiser for CSE graduates to prepare for entrepreneurship instead of only aiming for government jobs.</p>"},{"location":"bou-resources/bou-cse/11%20Semester/ENG/Writings%20Part/#what-is-a-paragraph-easy-formal-definition","title":"What is a Paragraph?
