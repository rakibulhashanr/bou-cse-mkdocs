## 📅 4-Day Smart Plan (EEE1135)

### 🔥 **Day 1 — Master Circuit Principles**

* ✅ KVL, KCL (definitions + sign rules + simple loop current Qs)
* ✅ Thevenin’s Theorem + Max Power Transfer proof
* ✅ Superposition Theorem with example
* ✅ Series-parallel resistor calc + Ohm’s Law
* ⏱ 3 hrs + 30 min revision

---

### 🔥 **Day 2 — AC Fundamentals**

* ✅ AC waveform parts: amplitude, cycle, peak-to-peak
* ✅ Derive:

  * $I_{rms} = 0.707 I_m$
  * $I_{avg} = 0.637 I_m$
* ✅ Power factor basics
* ✅ Solve 1–2 waveform-based numerical Qs
* ⏱ 3 hrs + 1 hr past paper practice

---

### 🔥 **Day 3 — Resonance & RLC Circuits**

* ✅ Define resonance, draw curve
* ✅ Derive bandwidth & Q-factor relationship
* ✅ Half-power frequency formulas
* ✅ Vector diagram across capacitor/inductor
* ⏱ 2.5 hrs + 1.5 hr practice

---

### 🧠 **Day 4 — Light Revision + 1 Backup Topic**

#### 🧾 Quick Review (2 hrs)

* All 3 major chapters (Circuit + AC + Resonance)

#### 📦 Optional Backup Topics (Choose 1):

* ⚡ **Coulomb’s Law**: Derive from Gauss + force between particles
* ⚡ **Electric Field**: Dipole & field intensity numerics

Then:

* 🔁 Solve 3 past sets by picking 5 questions in each
* ✅ Mark ones you’re 100% confident in

---

## 🚨 Priority Tip:

If you can master **Circuit Principles + AC + Resonance**, you can confidently solve **5+** questions in every set.
