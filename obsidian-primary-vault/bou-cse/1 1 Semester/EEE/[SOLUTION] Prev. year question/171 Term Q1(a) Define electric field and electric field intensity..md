## üî∑ **1. Electric Field ‚Äì Definition and Concept**

### üî∏ **Definition:**

The **electric field** is a region of space around a charged object within which another charge experiences an electric force. It is an **invisible field** that exerts **force on other electric charges** in its vicinity.

It is **not a physical quantity** but a **conceptual space** created due to a charge.

---

### üî∏ **Example:**

Around a charged balloon or a thundercloud, small paper pieces or dust particles are influenced without contact ‚Äî that's due to the **electric field** in that region.

---

## üî∑ **2. Electric Field Intensity ‚Äì Definition and Formula**

### üî∏ **Definition:**

The **Electric Field Intensity** (or Electric Field Strength), denoted by $\vec{E}$, is defined as the **force experienced per unit positive test charge** placed at a point in the field.

$$
\boxed{\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}}
$$

Where:

* $\vec{E}$ = Electric field intensity
* $\vec{F}$ = Force acting on the test charge
* $q$ = Magnitude of the test charge

---

## üî∑ **3. Mathematical Expression from a Point Charge**

If the source of the field is a point charge $Q$, then the field intensity at a distance $r$ is:

$$
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
$$

Where:

* $\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m}$ (permittivity of free space)
* $\hat{r}$ = Unit vector from charge $Q$ to observation point
* Direction of $\vec{E}$ is **outward** for positive $Q$ and **inward** for negative $Q$

## üî∑ **4. Units and Dimensions**

| Property            | Value                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SI Unit             | Newton per Coulomb (N/C) or Volt per meter (V/m) |
| Dimensional Formula | $[MLT^{-3}A^{-1}]$                               |

---

## üî∑ **5. Physical Significance**

* The electric field intensity indicates the **strength** of the field at a point.
* It is a **vector** ‚Äî it has both magnitude and direction.
* The higher the electric field intensity, the **stronger the force** on nearby charges.
* The direction of $\vec{E}$ is always **in the direction of the force on a positive charge**.

## üîÅ **6. Difference: Electric Field vs. Electric Field Intensity**

| Aspect     | Electric Field            | Electric Field Intensity   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Nature     | Region around charge      | Vector quantity at a point |
| Definition | Space in which force acts | Force per unit charge      |
| Symbol     | Conceptual (no symbol)    | $\vec{E}$                  |
| Unit       | ‚Äî                         | N/C or V/m                 |
| Measurable | No (field is abstract)    | Yes (measurable quantity)  |

---

## üî∑ **7. Real-Life Application**

* **Capacitors**: Electric field intensity helps calculate the voltage across plates and energy stored.
* **Electric sensors**: Devices detect small variations in electric field intensity (e.g. touchscreen, electric fish sensors).
* **Lightning rod**: Works by discharging strong electric field around a sharp conductor.

---

## üß† **Conclusion:**

The **electric field** is a fundamental concept describing how charges influence the space around them, while the **electric field intensity** quantifies that influence as a measurable vector quantity. Understanding the difference is essential for solving problems in **electrostatics, circuit theory**, and **electromagnetic field analysis**.
