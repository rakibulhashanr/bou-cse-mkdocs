### ‚úÖ Enhanced University-Level Question (20 Marks):

**Q7 (i):**
Write detailed short notes on the concepts of **Electric Field** and **Electric Flux**. In your explanation, define each term, state their mathematical expressions, physical interpretations, units, dimensional formulas, and highlight the differences between them with examples or diagrams where appropriate.

### ‚úÖStructured Answer:

## üî∑ **1. Electric Field ( $\vec{E}$ )**

### üî∏ **Definition:**

The electric field at a point in space is the **force experienced per unit positive test charge** placed at that point.

$$
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}
$$

Where:

* $\vec{E}$ = Electric field intensity (vector)
* $\vec{F}$ = Force experienced by a test charge
* $q$ = Test charge

---

### üî∏ **Expression for a Point Charge:**

$$
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
$$

* $Q$ = Source charge
* $r$ = Distance from the charge
* $\hat{r}$ = Unit vector from source to observation point

---

### üî∏ **Physical Meaning:**

* Represents the **influence** a charge exerts on other charges nearby.
* Always **points away** from positive charges and **towards** negative ones.
* It is a **vector field**.

### üî∏ **Units and Dimensions:**

| Property            | Value                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| SI Unit             | $\text{N/C}$ or $\text{V/m}$ |
| Dimensional Formula | $[MLT^{-3}A^{-1}]$           |

## üî∑ **2. Electric Flux ( $\Phi_E$ )**

### üî∏ **Definition:**

Electric flux is a **measure of the number of electric field lines** passing through a given surface.

$$
\Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = EA\cos\theta
$$

Where:

* $\Phi_E$ = Electric flux
* $\vec{E}$ = Electric field vector
* $\vec{A}$ = Area vector
* $\theta$ = Angle between $\vec{E}$ and normal to the surface

---

### üî∏ **Gauss's Law (Relation to Flux):**

$$
\Phi_E = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

* Total electric flux through a closed surface equals the **net charge enclosed** divided by $\varepsilon_0$.

---

### üî∏ **Physical Meaning:**

* Higher flux means **stronger field or larger area** aligned with the field.
* Zero flux means field lines are **parallel** to the surface or **net enclosed charge is zero**.

### üî∏ **Units and Dimensions:**

| Property            | Value                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| SI Unit             | $\text{N¬∑m}^2/\text{C}$ |
| Dimensional Formula | $[ML^3T^{-3}A^{-1}]$    |

## üîÅ **Difference Between Electric Field and Electric Flux**

| Feature       | **Electric Field ( $\vec{E}$ )** | **Electric Flux ( $\Phi_E$ )**              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Quantity Type | Vector                           | Scalar                                      |
| Describes     | Force per unit charge            | Number of field lines                       |
| Depends On    | Source charge & distance         | Field strength & surface area               |
| Unit          | N/C or V/m                       | N¬∑m¬≤/C                                      |
| Direction     | Has direction                    | No direction (scalar)                       |
| Example       | Field around a point charge      | Flux through a surface enclosing the charge |

## üß† **Conclusion:**

Both **electric field** and **electric flux** are fundamental to understanding **electrostatics**. While the electric field describes **how charges interact**, electric flux helps in **visualizing and quantifying** how the field spreads through space‚Äîespecially in the context of **Gauss‚Äôs Law**, which is essential in deriving field expressions for symmetric charge distributions.
