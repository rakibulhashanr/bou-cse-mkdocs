## **📘 Revision Note: Intonation and Stress (ENG1131)**

---
### 🔊 **Intonation:**

* **Definition:** The *rise and fall of pitch* in our voice when we speak. It **doesn’t change word meaning** but expresses emotion, attitude, and grammar.
* **Key Idea:** Intonation shows *how* something is said, not *what* is said.
* **Example:** Say “Really?” with surprise or disbelief—the words are the same, but the pitch makes it different.
