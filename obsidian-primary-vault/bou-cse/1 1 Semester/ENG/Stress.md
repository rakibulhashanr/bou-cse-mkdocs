## Stress – Formal Explanation (Easy Language)

In spoken English, **stress** means giving more strength or loudness to a syllable in a word, or to a word in a sentence, so it sounds clearer or more important than others. Stress helps listeners understand the meaning, emotion, or focus of what is being said.

There are two main types:
1. **Word Stress** – when one part (syllable) of a word is spoken more strongly.
2. **Sentence Stress** – when important words in a sentence are spoken with more emphasis.

## Word Stress Example:

### Word: *Present*  
- If you say **PREsent** (stress on first syllable) → noun meaning a gift.  
- If you say **preSENT** (stress on second syllable) → verb meaning to show or offer.

### Word: *Import*  
- **IMport** (noun): *Bangladesh increased the import of medicine.*  
- **imPORT** (verb): *They import oil from abroad.*

## Sentence Stress Example:

- **He *borrowed* my book.** → Stress on *borrowed* shows action is important.  
- **He borrowed *my* book.** → Stress on *my* shows ownership is the focus.  
- **He borrowed my *book*.** → Stress on *book* shows the object is key.

## Why Stress Matters:

Stress changes the meaning, improves clarity, and shows emotion or intention. Native speakers naturally use stress, while non-native learners need practice to sound natural and be easily understood.

## How Stress is Marked in Phonetics:

In the **IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)** system:
- A **vertical line (ˈ)** before the stressed syllable shows word stress.  
  Example: /ˈha.pɪ/ → **HAP-py**

## Intonation – Easy Definition  
**Intonation** is the rise and fall of voice while speaking.  
It helps to show emotions, ask questions, give commands, or express surprise.

Intonation is important in spoken English because it tells the listener:
- What kind of sentence is being used (question, command, feeling)
- What the speaker thinks or feels
- Which words are important
## Types of Intonation

### 1. Rising Intonation  
**Voice rises at the end of the sentence.**  
It is used in:
- Yes/No questions  
- Expressions of surprise or disbelief  
- Offers, suggestions, or polite requests  
- Listing things

**Examples:**
- You’re going to Sylhet tomorrow?  
- Really? You did?  
- I bought papers, bananas, pencils and chocolate.  
- Is this music good?  
- Did you enjoy the movie?
### 2. Falling Intonation  
**Voice falls at the end of the sentence.**  
It is used in:
- Wh-questions  
- Statements or facts  
- Commands and instructions  
- Exclamations and strong emotions

**Examples:**
- Tomorrow I’m going to Chittagong.  
- Which book is suitable for you?  
- What an exciting show!  
- Lita, study your lesson now.  
- Water is good for the body.


## Functions of Intonation

Intonation helps in:
- Expressing emotions like confidence, doubt, joy, or sarcasm  
- Making grammar and sentence structure clearer  
- Showing the difference between old and new information  
- Signaling contrast or connection between ideas  
- Indicating what kind of response the speaker expects in a conversation

## Analogy for Better Understanding  
**Think of intonation like the tune of music.**  
Even if you don’t understand the words, you can guess the emotion by listening to the tune.  
Similarly, intonation shows feelings and sentence types—just by changing how the voice moves.
