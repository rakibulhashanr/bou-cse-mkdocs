### **Should CSE Graduates Prepare for Entrepreneurship Instead of Government Jobs?**

In recent years, the career choice between **entrepreneurship** and **government jobs** has become a significant topic of debate among **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** graduates. While many still prefer the security of government jobs, the rapidly growing tech industry offers limitless possibilities for innovation and independence. **This essay argues that CSE graduates should seriously consider preparing for entrepreneurship rather than solely focusing on government employment, as it offers greater opportunities for creativity, self-growth, and national development.**

**Firstly, entrepreneurship allows CSE graduates to use their technical skills in creative and independent ways.** In government jobs, tasks are often routine, structured, and limited by bureaucracy. On the other hand, a CSE graduate starting a tech startup can develop mobile apps, AI systems, or software products that directly solve real-world problems. This flexibility allows them to express innovation and contribute meaningfully to society.

**Secondly, entrepreneurship provides financial freedom and long-term growth potential.** Government jobs offer fixed salaries and slow promotions, which may not reflect the true capabilities of a skilled CSE graduate. In contrast, a successful tech entrepreneur can earn significantly more, create jobs for others, and even attract global investment. Many tech giants like Pathao, Sheba.xyz, or bKash were started by bold individuals, not job seekers.

**Thirdly, entrepreneurs can contribute more actively to national progress and the digital economy.** Bangladesh needs more job creators, not job seekers. When CSE graduates build startups, they create employment, reduce brain drain, and promote technological advancement in the country. This is more impactful than serving in limited government positions where innovation may be restricted.

**However, government jobs still hold value for those seeking stability and service to the nation through public institutions.** Some graduates may prefer a fixed path and pension system. But CSE, being a field of innovation, aligns better with entrepreneurial ventures than with traditional government roles.

In conclusion, **while government jobs offer stability, entrepreneurship offers freedom, innovation, and growth.** For CSE graduates, whose skills are suited for rapid digital transformation, entrepreneurship is not only a personal opportunity but also a national necessity. **Therefore, it is wiser for CSE graduates to prepare for entrepreneurship instead of only aiming for government jobs.**

### **What is a Paragraph?** *(Easy, formal definition)*

A **paragraph** is a group of connected sentences that together explain **one main idea**. It is like a **mini-essay** ‚Äî it begins with an introduction (the main idea), expands with explanations or examples (the body), and ends with a summary or result (the conclusion).

üîé **Analogy**: Think of a paragraph like a **burger**. The **top bun** is the topic sentence (introduction), the **fillings** are the supporting sentences (details, examples), and the **bottom bun** is the concluding sentence (wrap-up).

### **Main Rules of Composing a Paragraph**

**(For 6 Marks ‚Äî Clear and Formal Explanation)**

1. **Unity**
   All the sentences in a paragraph must focus on **one single idea or topic**. If you talk about two different things in one paragraph, it becomes confusing.
   ‚úîÔ∏è *Example*: If your topic is "The importance of reading," don‚Äôt suddenly start writing about "watching movies."

2. **Coherence**
   The sentences should be arranged in a **logical order**. Each sentence should flow naturally into the next. This helps the reader understand your idea smoothly.
   ‚úîÔ∏è *Tip*: Use linking words like **however**, **in addition**, **therefore**, **firstly**, etc., to guide the reader.

3. **Topic Sentence**
   This is usually the **first sentence** of the paragraph. It introduces the **main idea**.
   ‚úîÔ∏è *Example*: ‚ÄúReading books regularly improves language skills.‚Äù ‚Äî This gives a clear idea of what the paragraph will discuss.

4. **Supporting Sentences**
   These sentences **explain, describe, or give examples** of the main idea. They make the paragraph informative and meaningful.
   ‚úîÔ∏è *Example*: "It helps improve vocabulary and grammar." / "It also boosts imagination and creativity."

5. **Concluding Sentence**
   The last sentence should **summarize** the main idea or give a result, suggestion, or opinion.
   ‚úîÔ∏è *Example*: ‚ÄúTherefore, reading is essential for both personal and academic growth.‚Äù

6. **Proper Length and Structure**
   A good paragraph should neither be too short nor too long. Usually, **5 to 8 sentences** is a healthy length. Every paragraph should have a clear **beginning, middle, and end**.

### **Plagiarism in the Academic Community**

**By a Staff Reporter**
**Dhaka, July 3, 2025**

Plagiarism (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶ö‡ßå‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡¶æ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶æ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞) has become an alarming (‡¶â‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶ó‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶ï) issue in the academic community (‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶°‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ú) of Bangladesh in recent years.

According to recent surveys (‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶ú‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶™ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡ßü‡ßÄ) conducted by several private universities, nearly 40% of students admitted to using online content in their assignments without citation (‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏ ‡¶â‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶ñ ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡ßú‡¶æ)‡•§ The availability (‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶ú ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶§‡¶æ) of internet and pressure of deadlines (‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∑ ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßü‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶™) have made students rely on copy-paste methods instead of producing original (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶§‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶ø) work. In some cases, even thesis papers and journal articles are found to be plagiarized (‡¶®‡¶ï‡¶≤ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶π‡ßü‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá).

Teachers and scholars (‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ï ‡¶ì ‡¶™‡¶£‡ßç‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶∞‡¶æ) warn that plagiarism not only damages academic integrity (‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶§ ‡¶∏‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶®‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá), but also weakens intellectual development (‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂ ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá). ‚ÄúIf students stop thinking critically (‡¶ó‡¶≠‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶¶‡ßá‡ßü) and just copy others, we are not building a skilled future generation,‚Äù said Dr. Salma Akhter, a professor at a reputed (‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶†‡¶ø‡¶§) public university.

Most institutions still lack strict policies (‡¶ï‡¶†‡ßã‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶á) or modern tools like plagiarism detection software (‡¶®‡¶ï‡¶≤ ‡¶∂‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶£ ‡¶∏‡¶´‡¶ü‡¶ì‡ßü‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶∞). As a result, many cases go unnoticed (‡¶Ö‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶•‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡ßü) or unpunished (‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶π‡ßÄ‡¶®)‡•§ However, a few universities have started awareness campaigns (‡¶∏‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶§‡¶®‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶Æ) and training on academic ethics (‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶§ ‡¶®‡ßà‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶§‡¶æ) and referencing techniques (‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏ ‡¶â‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶ñ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡ßå‡¶∂‡¶≤).

Experts suggest that awareness (‡¶∏‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶§‡¶®‡¶§‡¶æ) must begin from the school level. Students should be taught how to write in their own words and properly credit sources. Institutions must apply strict penalties (‡¶ï‡¶†‡ßã‡¶∞ ‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø) for dishonesty (‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡¶§‡¶§‡¶æ) and encourage originality (‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶≤ ‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶æ) and creativity (‡¶∏‡ßÉ‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶∂‡ßÄ‡¶≤‡¶§‡¶æ).

In conclusion, if plagiarism is not controlled through proper education, monitoring (‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶£), and policy (‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø), the quality of education and research will continue to decline (‡¶™‡¶§‡¶®‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá).
