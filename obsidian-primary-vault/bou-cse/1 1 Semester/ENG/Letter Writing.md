### **Your Favourite Personality**

My most favourite personality is **Hazrat Muhammad (SM)**, the last Prophet of Islam. What makes him so special to me is not just that he was a prophet, but the kind of **extraordinary person** he was in every role of life. He was a perfect human being ‚Äî an ideal father, teacher, leader, friend, and even a warrior.

As a **father**, he was loving and gentle. He used to stand up when his daughter Fatima (RA) entered the room and treated her with the highest respect. He played with children, smiled at them, and never scolded them harshly. His love for his family was deep, but he was also fair and never gave them special treatment.

As a **teacher**, he was patient, wise, and clear. He taught people through simple words and even simpler actions. He never forced people but inspired them with kindness and good character. His life itself was the greatest lesson. He said, ‚ÄúThe best among you are those who have the best manners.‚Äù

As a **warrior**, he was brave yet merciful. In battles, he showed discipline and only fought to defend truth and justice. He never attacked innocent people and even forgave enemies who once tried to harm him. Despite being powerful, he remained humble and avoided pride.

As a **leader**, he was honest, just, and caring. He lived a simple life, shared food with the poor, and treated everyone equally ‚Äî rich or poor, black or white. Even his enemies trusted him for his honesty.

Hazrat Muhammad (SM)‚Äôs life teaches me how to live with dignity, love, and responsibility. His character is a complete model for all humanity. That is why he is not only my favourite personality, but also my **greatest inspiration**.

**Subject:** Tips to Adjust to Life in Australia

Dear Sabrina,

I hope this email finds you well. I heard you‚Äôve finally settled in Australia ‚Äî congratulations! I can imagine how exciting and challenging this new journey must be for you.

Moving to a new country is never easy at first, but with time, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll adjust. Try to keep an open mind about the **new culture and lifestyle**. Australians are friendly and informal, so don‚Äôt hesitate to talk to people and make new friends. It will help you feel more at home.

About the **food**, I know it can be different from what we‚Äôre used to, but give it a try! You might enjoy some of the local dishes like meat pies, fish and chips, or even Vegemite (though it's an acquired taste!). At the same time, explore nearby Asian or Indian stores ‚Äî you‚Äôll likely find ingredients to cook your favourite Bangladeshi meals too.

Also, try to **adapt to their daily routine**, time zone, and weather. Australia‚Äôs climate is quite different, so dress accordingly and stay healthy. Don't be shy about asking for help or information ‚Äî people there usually appreciate curiosity and respect for their culture.

Lastly, stay connected with your roots but embrace the change. This experience will help you grow and learn in ways you never imagined.

Take care and write back soon. I‚Äôd love to hear about your new experiences!

Warm wishes,
**Rakib**
