### 🧠 **My Observation:**

* At least **60–70% of the questions repeat each term or year**.
* Focus is mostly on **conversion, binary math, OS types, flowcharts, and number systems**.
* Questions are **rotated slightly in structure** (e.g., “Explain 1’s complement” vs “Find result using 1’s complement”).
