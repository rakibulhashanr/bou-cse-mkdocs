### **Q: What is a Computer Network? What are its Goals?**

A **computer network** is a structured system that interconnects multiple computing devices such as computers, servers, printers, mobile devices, and other hardware components using communication channels. These channels may be **wired** (such as coaxial cables, twisted pair cables, fiber optics) or **wireless** (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite, infrared). The primary purpose of networking is to facilitate the **sharing of data, resources, applications, and services** among multiple users in a secure, reliable, and efficient manner.

In a computer network, devices, often referred to as **nodes**, can communicate with one another based on a defined set of protocols (such as TCP/IP). These nodes are interconnected using **network devices** such as routers, switches, hubs, and modems. Depending on their geographical spread, networks may be classified as **Local Area Network (LAN)**, **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**, **Wide Area Network (WAN)**, or **Personal Area Network (PAN)**.

#### **Goals of a Computer Network:**

1. **Resource Sharing:** One of the fundamental objectives is to enable the sharing of hardware (e.g., printers, scanners), software (e.g., licensed applications), and data files, thereby reducing redundancy and operational cost.

2. **High Reliability:** By providing alternate sources of data and services, networks can ensure system reliability. If one server fails, another may serve as a backup, ensuring continuity of operation.

3. **Cost Efficiency:** Networks reduce the cost of ownership by minimizing the need for duplicate hardware or software across multiple devices. Centralized management also decreases administrative overhead.

4. **Effective Communication:** Networking enables faster and more efficient communication through emails, instant messaging, video conferencing, and collaborative platforms across distant locations.

5. **Scalability:** Modern networks are designed to accommodate growth. New devices can be added easily without affecting existing network operations.

6. **Centralized Data Management:** A network allows centralized storage, management, and backup of organizational data, improving security and ease of access.

7. **Security and Authorization:** Networking helps enforce security policies such as access control, encryption, and user authentication, which are vital for protecting sensitive information.

8. **Remote Accessibility:** Through networking technologies, users can access resources remotely from any location, facilitating mobile computing and remote work environments.

In conclusion, a computer network is an essential infrastructure that underpins modern computing, enabling efficient communication, collaboration, and resource utilization across all sectors of society.
