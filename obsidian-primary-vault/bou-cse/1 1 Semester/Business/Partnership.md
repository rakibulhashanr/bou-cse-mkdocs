## Elements of Partnership Business (Simplified Explanation)

### 1. **Lawful Business**

A partnership can only be formed for a business that is legal. The word "business" here includes all types of work like trade, profession, or occupation. The main goal of forming a partnership is to carry on a lawful business. Activities that are illegal cannot be the purpose of a partnership.

---

### 2. **Name of the Business**

Every partnership firm must have its own name. This name is used to identify the business and is known as the **firm name**. It is the name under which the business operates.

---

### 3. **Association of Persons**

To form a partnership, there must be at least **two persons**. One person alone cannot start a partnership.
The **Indian Partnership Act** does not set a maximum limit on the number of partners. However, under the **Companies Act**:

* In **banking business**, maximum number of partners allowed is **10**.
* In **other businesses**, the maximum number is **20**.

---

### 4. **Profit Motive and Sharing of Profits**

A partnership is formed with the goal of earning profit. The profit that the business earns is shared among the partners based on a pre-agreed **profit-sharing ratio**.
This ratio is usually mentioned in the partnership agreement.

---

### 5. **Contractual Relationship**

A partnership is created by an agreement between two or more persons who are legally able to enter into a contract.
The partnership relationship is not automatic or based on family ties â€” it must be formed by a **contract**, either written or oral.

---

### 6. **Mutual Trust and Confidence**

The proper functioning of a partnership depends on the trust and confidence the partners have in each other.
All partners are expected to act honestly, with fairness, and maintain good faith in their business actions and decisions.

---

### 7. **Principal-Agent Relationship**

In a partnership, it is not necessary that all partners manage the business directly.
Any partner can carry out business on behalf of all the others.
This means that **each partner is an agent** (representative) of the firm and also a **principal** (someone who gives authority to others).
Whatever actions one partner takes (within the business scope), all partners are responsible for it.

---

### 8. **Restrictions on Transfer of Share**

A partner cannot sell, give, or transfer his share in the partnership to someone outside the firm without getting permission from all the other partners.
So, no partner can bring a new person into the partnership or give away their share without agreement from the rest.

---

### 9. **Unlimited Liability**

In a partnership, the **personal assets** (house, car, bank balance, etc.) of the partners can be used to pay off the debts of the business.
If the firmâ€™s money is not enough to pay the creditors (people or businesses the firm owes money to), then the personal property of partners can be taken to cover the debt.

---
