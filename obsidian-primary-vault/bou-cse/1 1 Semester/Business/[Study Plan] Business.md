### ✅ Tips:

* Focus most on **Ownership**, **HRM**, and **Accounting**.
* Chapters like **Production & Operation** are low-frequency—read lightly.
* Practice past paper MCQs or 14-mark questions during the last 30 mins.

Got it — it's now **2:34 AM**, and you have only **8 hours left** before your **BUS1123 exam**. That means you must finish revision by around **10:30 AM** (allowing time to freshen up, commute, or rest).
