| Day       | Focus                       | Chapters                                                               | Goals                                                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 1** | 💡 Foundation + Derivatives | Functions & Models<br>Limits & Derivatives<br>Rules of Differentiation | Revise domain/range, continuity, limit tricks<br>Master L'Hospital, Chain/Log/Implicit/Inverse |

### 🔍 What about **Functions & Models**?

According to the heatmap and all 5 sets:

* **Functions & Models** appeared **in all 5 terms**, but...
* It's always **only 1 question** (often Q1a or Q1b), usually **domain/range**, **graph sketching**, or **continuity check**.
* **Marks weight**: 3 to 6 marks per term — **low to moderate**.

### 🧠 So What Should You Do?

| Why It Matters     | Why It's Lower Priority     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Appears every term | Only 1 question per set     |
| Easy to revise     | Questions are repetitive    |
| Good for warm-up   | Doesn't dominate your score |

---

### ✅ Recommended Plan for Functions & Models:

**Day 1 — Warm-up (30 mins)**

* Revise:

  * Domain/Range rules
  * Absolute value function graphs
  * Piecewise continuity/differentiability logic

**Day 4 — Quick Review (15 mins)**

* Practice 1 graph sketching + 1 domain-range from old terms

---

### TL;DR:

> 📘 **Functions & Models** is **important but light**. Don't ignore it — just cover it smartly and early. It'll help boost confidence and start your sessions smoothly.
